- Discussion on Midsem paper:
    - Nothing productive at all
    - No acknowledgement of problems with the paper
- What is Software Design:
    - Blueprint of the Software
    - **Official**: process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact, intended to ...
- What is **High Level Design**:
    - Big Picture of the Software, Software Architecture
    - Design of each of those components of the Software Architecture is HLD.
- Overview of the day:
    - SA introduction
    - Traits
    - SA Paradox
    - Examples
- Architecture:
    - "decisions ..."
    - "decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project"
    - Formal description of a system, or detailed plan at component level to guide implementation -- def 1
    - Structure of components ... -- def 2
    - Something something **Complexity**, **Modularity**
    - What is Software Complexity:
        - *Lehman's Law*: with evolution, complexity increases if there is no active work done to reduce it.
        - *Gall's Law*: complex system that works invariably evolved from simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch cannot work, and cannot be patched to work either.
        - Keep code as simple as possible and as complex as necessary - Venks
        - *How to Manage Complexity*:

    - What is Software Modularity:
