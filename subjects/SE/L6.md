# Introduction to Programming Paradigms

- Number of programming languages:
    - TIOBE Criteria for programming languages: Turing complete, Wikipedia page, 5000 google results > 250 languages
    - 700 languages as per Wikipedia page existence
    - 8000 languages, relaxing the Wikipedia page
- Decisions that need to be made:
    - Statically/Dynamically typed?
    - Are mutations allowed?
    - **These decisions together are paradigm**:
        - Thought process gets affected by the paradigm of the language
- Languages vs Paradigms:
    - Limited number of paradigms, compared to languages
    - We can learn languages easier (using common concepts) by studying their paradigms

| Language | Paradigm        |   |
|----------|-----------------|---|
| Java     | Object Oriented |   |
| Python   | Object Oriented |   |
| ...      | ...             |   |

## Imperative Programming paradigms

- First one in place, from the 50s
- Explicit Order of Execution
- Change of State
- Explains how program works

## Imperative Procedural paradigm

- Adds a procedure call to the imperative paradigm
- Makes it more modular

## Imperative Object-Oriented paradigm

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- Common
- Model maps to hardware
- Easy
- More control to programmer

### Disadvantages

- Difficult to debug, mutability
- Difficult to read/maintain
- Difficult to create concurrent systems
- Easy to make mistakes


## Declarative Paradigm

- Implicit Order of Execution
- State mutation is abstracted out
- Abstraction on top of imperative (underlying hardware is always imperative)
- Example: markup languages

## Declarative Functional Programming

- Based on Lambda Calculus
- Imperative - assigning memory - state change

## Declarative Logic Programming

- Based on Predicate Calculus
