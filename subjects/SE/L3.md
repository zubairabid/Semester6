# Art of Clean Code: Fundamentals

- Code is written for humans
- Broken window metaphor: even one bad sample/example of code encourages bad code from others
- Boys Scout Rule: Always leave the place cleaner than you found it
- Definition of clean code:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    - 4

## Functions

- Complications are an issue:
    - People writing large methods is not great
    - Keep a method as small as possible, as large as necessary
- Functions should do exactly one thing, and one level of abstraction per function:
    - How to ensure this level of abstraction correctly?
    - One approach: Based on number of arguments - ideally 0, then 1, 2, or maybe 3. But more than 3 needs justification:
        - eg: `makeCircle(x, y, radius)` vs `makeCircle(Point, radius)`. The second gives us clean semantic structure, less confusion in the argument ordering, and ease of validation
    - Input validation: XKCD example of SQL injection
- Right way to name:
    - classes should be Nouns
    - methods should be verb/noun naming:
        - `assertExpectedEqualsActual` is considered better than `asserEquals` as the argument ordering is clearer (easier to read)
- Do not pass flags:
    - indicated that there is more than one task being done
- Do not pass nulls

Methods with $$leq$$ three arguments is **always** recommended. Can be excepted, like in the case of constructors, or maybe some special cases. But avoid if possible.

Leave micro-optimizations to the compiler. They're smart enough

** Important: Concept of `Optionals` like in Java: useful as they force function caller to consider possibility of `NULL`s without dealing with and passing them**

Have **immutable input** and **immutable output**

- Avoiding side effects:
    - Either **do something** or **answer something**
    - For this, use **intentionally revealing names**. If you want to update something, name it `updateBlahBlahWhatever`
