- Topics for class - Working with Design Patterns:
    - Overview
    - Creational Design Patterns
    - Structural Design Patterns
    - Behavioural Design Patterns
- Overview:
    - Object Oriented Design steps:
        - Identify Objects, responsibilities
        - Identify structure
        - Identify interactions
        - Identify behaviour
    - When dealing with multiple problems, designers will keep running into similar solution styles for different problems.
    - **Design Pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring design problem:
        - **general**: Situation different, problem different: but problem looks similar
        - **reusable**: reusable design solution, not just code
        - **commonly occurring**: patterns cannot be used for very specific problem
    - ((( Never assume a language restricts you from using a paradigm )))
    - Design Pattern Categories, based on purpose:
        - Creational Design Patterns
        - Structural Design Patterns
        - Behavioural Design Patterns
    - Design Pattern Categories, based on scope:
        - Class based Design Patterns
        - Object based Design Patterns
        - Why bother with mental models? We not go into an existential rant about why this is necessary, justification for the level of abstraction involved in the whole process of figuring out design patterns. They're necessary, evidently, because it's a technical problem that needs to be modelled out, without which it would not be possible to do it.
    - ~~this is one of the most important classes of the course~~
    - **Object Oriented Basics**:
        - *Concrete Classes*: They handle some of the functionality themselves
        - *Abstract Classes*: Like in Java, some other class extends and implements the definitions by the abstract classes. Much like Interfaces.
        - *Interfaces*
        - *Inheritance*
        - *Composition*
    - **Creational Design Patterns**:
        - **Builder Pattern**:
            - Delegates creation of complex object to another object
            - Code example
            
                ```
                Locale aLocale = new Locale.Builder()
                    .setLanguage("sr")
                    .setScript("Latn")
                    .setRegion("RS")
                    .build();
                ```
            - More readable
            - Can deal with unset variables
