- Recap:
    - Some bull
    - **Question**: Builder difference from Factory? **Ans**: To be answered later.
    - **Question**: why not setter-getter? **Ans**: Object creation will have inconsistent state, rather than just a builder object with this state.
- Creational Patterns, continued:
    - **Factory Method Pattern**:
        - Delegates creation of object to the Creator. 
        - `Creator`, `ConcreteCreator`, and `Product`
        - A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
        - Essentially, Polymorphism in play
        - [Summary](https://www.javatpoint.com/factory-method-design-pattern)
- **Structural Design Patterns**:
    - Structuring relationships using:
        - inheritance
        - composition
    - **Adapter Pattern**:
        - Allows interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
        - `Client`, `Adapter`, `Adaptee`
    - **Decorator Pattern**:
        - Allows something? skipped over slides, we need to go over it ourselves.
- **Behavioral Design Patterns**:
    - ??
    - **State pattern**:
        - encapsulate behaviour for same object, based on internal state.
