- Logistics:
    - Assignment will be given today
- Recap:
    - Always vs Usually Applicable
    - Functions:
        - `leq` 3 arguments
        - name should be verb+Noun
        - Number of lines <= 7-9
        - Methods should have no side effects
        - Flags should not be passed as arguments
        - Inputs should be validated
    - Everything should have tests
- Comments:
    - Rewrite bad code
    - Explaining through code preferred over comments 
      
        eg: `employee.isEligibleForFullBenefirs()` vs `(employee.flags && HOURLY_FLAG) && (...)`
        
        **Code can be tested, comments can't**
    - Use documentation systems (like Javadocs)
- General comments on Naming:
    - If a function name is too large, it's *probably* doing too much
    - Global teams are a thing, less reliance on comments is a good thing
    - Limit function names to a maximum of 20 characters
    - Be specific, but not too specific, and not too generic
- Clean Tests:
    - Properties:
        - Fast
        - Independent
        - Repeatable
        - Boolean Output
        - Written alongside/before production code
- Visual Description of Code:
    - Clear visual thinking
    - Things are designed to be read vertically
    - `diff`s are line-based, consider that
    - Don't have too many levels
    - The *feeling* of good vs bad code
- Lego Naming:
    - (( Something ))
- Assignment:
    - Go look at some code and clean it up
    - `javaargs`

## Misc

- **Are one line functions a good idea?** 
  
    Not usually, but it has its use cases: Reliability, Readability, Reusability
