- Code Reading takes **most of career time**:
    - Code reviews require it
    - Debugging requires it
    - Adding features require it
- When given a new class, *TODO*:
    - Big picture context
    - Type of class
    - State of class/mutability
- **Big Picture context for the class, and responsibilities**:
    - Read JavaDoc
    - Google if public library
    - Read Tests if they exist
    - Talk to people
- **What is the type of Class**?
    - Abstract, concrete, Interface
    - Generic `<Template>` Used
- **Is it stateful? Is it mutable**?
    - Find `fields`
    - Find `setters/getters`, and other methods changing these fields
    - Immutable means:
        - class is threadsafe
        - Class state is always consistent
        - Objects can be safely passed
- **What are class dependencies? Is it using any structural design patterns**?
    - Inspect imports
    - Search for new
    - Inspect constructors
- **How is the class instantiated? Is it using any creational Design patterns**?
    - eg: `StaticFactoryMethod Pattern`
    - or, `Singleton`
- **What public interface does it expose? Do methods use any *behavioural design patterns*.**:
- **Is the code clean**:
    - Inspect class, method, variable names
    - Look for bad comments
    - Look for bad methods
    - Too many params
    - flag args
    - DRY violations
    - ...
- **Is it following Design principles correctly**:
    - SRP
    - Open/Closed
    - Liskov Substitution
    - Interface suggestion
    - Dependency Inversion
- **How can I make it better**:
    - Follow the Boy Scout Rule
