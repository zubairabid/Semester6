## Lecture

- Distinction between framing of nature as religious and political mobolisation 
  of religion based on the ecology.
- **Essentially**: Difference between the interlinking of religion and nature, 
  and the use of the environment as a method to mobilise religion as a 
  political entity:
  - "Greening of Saffron": Hindu nationalist agenda is something, it is 
    greened by the inclusion of certain environmental issues. Eg: *Protection
    of the Ganga river*, *Tehri Dam project (harming mata Ganga)*
    - There's no across the spectrum mobilisation/position (No such movements 
      for the Narmada)
    - So, there's not much to talk about here as it's limited
  - "Saffronising the Green": Much bigger: taking the environmental agenda 
    and rewriting in a Hindu framework. Introducing certain concepts into the 
    environmental question, that now allow for more "hinduisation".
      - Notion of "purity"
      - Takes the idea of pollution: introducing a foreign object
      - Pollution of our space - migrants, foreigners, etc. 
      - Pollution is now being defined in cultural terms.
- Environmentalism and Right Wing Mobilisation:
    - Themes of *past glory, village society, 'Indian' culture*
    - Eco-enemies: *Immigrants, migrants, minorities, foreigners*
- Eg:
    - **Anna Hazare and Raliganj city:** <missed>. "Leave the nature as it is" 
    - ...
    - ...
    - Idolised
