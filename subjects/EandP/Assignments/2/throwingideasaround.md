- Local communities:
    - Forests as livelihood (subsistence)
    - Forests as capital resource (improvement)
    - Impact of forest existence (tiger attacks, elephants, etc) is on them
    - Solely Industrial use does not allow them to reap the benefits of having
        to deal with forest existence nearby
    - Conservationism does not allow them to live in their historically 
        habitated areas, alongside taking away means of livelihood
    - Forestry Department control aids the above two. Takes Forest Management,
        and often Use/habitation rights away from them.
- Industrialists:
    - Forests as land to be cleared for projects
    - Forests as raw resource for large-scale industrial use
- 'Elite' Conservationists:
    - Forests as protected, untouchable resource

    - losing control is bad.
