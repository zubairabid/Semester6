## Background 

- Currently, all rights given to Forest departments
- With lobbying, **Industrialists** and **Elite Conservationists** get their say,:
    - **Industrial**: Use 'development'; their agenda becomes developmental 
      agenda as well. Can work with conservationists too, claiming 
      reafforestation
    - **Elite Conservationists**: Use 'preservation'. Can work with industrial 
      use if there is afforestation, or some form of conservationist use.
      
    Media follows both narratives, either as 'pro-development' or 
    'pro-environment'. Not the local narratives.
- **Local Communities**, however, do not get a say. They are impacted as:
    - *Not allowed to stay in historically habitated areas*, due to 
      conservationist policies/govt status of land. "trespassers in their
      own land"
    - *Not allowed to use forest resources*, due to conservationist policies/ 
      Industrial usage requirements/'trespassers' by government definition
    - *Face the brunt of forest existence without enjoying benefits:* even if 
      they get habitation rights, they do not get usage rights/the usage is 
      curtailed by the forestry dept. But they have to deal with tigers taking
      cattle, or elephants fucking their crops. 
      
## FRA

- A Tribal Department led project.
- Primarily a **tribal/(forest-living classes) upliftment drive** (refer to 
  Manmohan), with farther reaching consequences than desired by any other party. 
- **Does not fit the corporate agenda.** "Development" is stalled by this, 
  as forests are now local property, and permission is needed to access it for
  any usage
- **Fits the conservationist idea**, but not in their eyes, initially. 
  This guy gives a reason why conservation is better done, but not in 'elite' 
  english media eyes

## Overall, Stakeholders in the process

- Local communities:
    - Forests as livelihood (subsistence)
    - Forests as capital resource (improvement)
    - Impact of forest existence (tiger attacks, elephants, etc) is on them
    - Solely Industrial use does not allow them to reap the benefits of having
        to deal with forest existence nearby
    - Conservationism does not allow them to live in their historically 
        habitated areas, alongside taking away means of livelihood
    - Forestry Department control aids the above two. Takes Forest Management,
        and often Use/habitation rights away from them.
- Industrialists:
    - Forests as land to be cleared for projects
    - Forests as raw resource for large-scale industrial use
    - Do not have to deal with existence of forest in day-to-day life when
        reaping the benefits
    - Solely Local use does not allow fulfilment of industrial agenda. This
        might sync up with a "development" agenda or not, but the need for
        the agenda is shown from time to time 
    - Solely conservationist use does not allow fulfilment of industrial
        agenda either.
    - Forestry Department control is sort of beneficial - lobbying with the
        government, as in the past, can get them access to forests for their
        agenda fulfilment.
- 'Elite' Conservationists:
    - Forests as protected, untouchable resource
    - Any usage of forests -- local or otherwise -- is bad
    - Solely local community use is bad, as any exploitation is bad.
    - Solely industrial use is double bas, as any exploitation bad:
        - However, since primary opposition is seen to the new acts that 
          benefit locals, where they were earlier disadvantaged, opposition 
          is given to these acts. Ignore the case that this means forest
          department has control implying industrial use is widespread
    - Solely forest department is not great - but they can enforce 
      conservationist policies, so they need to exist, implementing an 
      entirely conservationist framework.
- Forestry Department:
    - Seeks to control the forests, as historically has done
    - losing control is bad. For prestige, moneymaking, etc.
    - Solely local control is bad, as they lose control of "their forests" 
      
      Can, however, accept local usage under their control.
    - Solely conservationist control is bad, as they can't capitalise on 
      forests. 
      
      Can, however, accept some conservationist policies as long as they retain
      control, and make money.
    - Solely industrial control is bad, as they still don't have control 
      
      But if they retain control, Industrial use is fair play as *paisa*. 

## Justice and Rights

### Initial snippers of ideas 

- Utilitarian favours Corporate agenda in a climate where it is linked with 
  development of the community
- Rawl's conception favours individual liberty: so if the corporation is 
  treated as an individual and given such rights then they have the liberty to
  use the land. This is not the construction we have, as there is the thing 
  with (i forgot) (okay wait) (it's the ) government control.
- Social justice: justice for tribals and others living historically in the 
  forests. 
- Currently, we have government control of forests - with no rights to 
  localites. This is kind of utilitarian? In the sense that it was laws framed 
  to benefit solely the British usage of the land. 



**Mention the idea that various uses of forests are inter-conflicting and 
that resource usage in one way can mean the destruction of another form
of living**
