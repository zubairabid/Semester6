# Global Environmentalism I: Human-Nature relationships

## Human-Nature relationships

This Lecture is primarily on the changing Historical Conceptions of Man-Nature relationship.

Does not seem to have anything to keep in mind that will be directly asked as a question, but it is a foundational topic that can be used for arguments in future topics, and the like.

**Timeline**:

- In pre-scientific times, nature is sacred/powerful in some way:
    - **As an adversary**: feared, bringing catastrophe
    - **As a Divine Power**: punishing humans for misdeeds, to be worshipped/placated
- During the *Enlightenment*, **Nature as Dead Matter**, abiding by mechanical laws:
    - *Bacon, Descartes*: **Discover**, Master unknown laws of nature
    - *Modern Industrialism*: **Understand, and exploit**. Nature is a raw material to be utilised or exploited.
- *Romanticism*: Celebrating **Primitivism/rural lifestyle**:
    - *How*: Reaction to enlightenment and Industrial Revolution
    - *Concept*:
        - Nature as an alienated being. 
        - **Any use is exploitation**.
        - Human-animal co-existence is **criminalised**.
    - Foundational in modern Western models of environmentalism. Also see Vegans/Vegetarians
- **Marxist Conceptions**:

# Global Environmentalism II: Existing Political and Sociological Theories, Models of Environmental Utopia

## Traditional Sociological Theory on the Environment

What do "Fathers of Sociology" say about the Environment?

- **Weber**: nothing
- **Durkheim**: 
    In his work on suicides, he has a section considering human-nature relationships. But there is *no theoretical analysis, and he misses social/economic impacts on nature, and vice-versa**.
- **Marx, Engels**:
    - There is a *man-nature dialectic*
    - *Role of labour in transforming nature*
    - Alienation of nature
- **Giddens**:
    - Goes beyond "industrialism without capitalism". States, *Capitalism + Industrialism = environmental catastrophe*
- **Ulrich Beck**:
    - Idea of "Risk Society", specifically that *new risks need new institutionalised responses*
    - A shift in *organised irresponsibility* is required

## The Politics of it: Environmental Movements

Giddens and Habermas talk about this, primarily. They both define **Environmental Movements**: "Politics mobilised by *ideal values and moral imperatives*", and "response of the life world to its colonization" 

Also talking of the need to **Democratise Citizens-State relationships**. We consider here:

- Limitations of representative Democracy:
    - Case of *pressure groups*: **Effective, but not considering all aspects of discourse** (Habermas)
- Need for a "public sphere of rational discourse"
- Beck's claim that **"No policy is without politics"**

## Roots of Western Environmentalism

- Lynn White's **indictment of Christianity**:
    - *Bible asserts anthropocentricism*
    - Christianity asserts Man as "image of God", and other species as soulless. Hierarchy formed
- John Muir's **indictment of commercialism**:
    - Excessive focus on individual free enterprise leads to growing commercialism
    - Growing commercialism is bad for the environment
- Temperate Climate:
    - **Allows for easier romanticism of the Environment**, compared to tropical climates in India. Nature is not an adversary naturally.

## Environmental Utopias

- Agrarianism:
    - Based on philosophy of *golden means of stewardship*
    - Human-scale tech, peasant society, strong community bonds.
    - Stage II centric
    - Used in India
- Primitivism:
    - Based on philosophy of *human submission to nature*
    - No tech, hunter-gatherer society, strong community
    - Stage I centric
    - Used in the West
- Scientific Industrialism:
    - Based on the principle of *Scientific Conquest of the Environment*
    - Rejects the free market as a regulatory mechanism
    - Halting progress of Scientists in Stage III focus

# Themes of Indian Environmentalism

We take a more local perspective, to see **how Environmentalism narratives in India are**. 

## The Standard Environmental Narrative

We find there is a persistent framework:

- **Seeing things in binary**:
    - Mostly visible as "things changed, for the worse" (*the past was good, now it is bad*)
    - Things are *either perfect, or completely flawed*
- **History written as local control $$\to$$ settled central control**:
    - The central state is *always the enemy in the environmental narrative*
    - "always a Ravana"

### Criticisms

- **Archana Prasad**: The *Baigas and Gonds* contradict the **reading of tribes as technologically backwards, without trade networks** 
- **Rejecting the idea of harmonious Human-Animal Relationships**, by considering Tiger conflicts in 17th Century Bengal
- Generally, **weak evidence for all claims**

## Agrarian Change/Forest Transformation kinda follows this template

Narratives of Agrarian Change or Forest Transformation generally follow the SEN reading. While this is a flawed methodology of reading history, its predictions are not entirely off, such as with the advent of Colonial Rule in India. So, there are books following this narrative that make sense, essentially.

Then, we look at three books written. 

- This Fissured Land:
    - **PART 1: Patterns of Resource Use**:
        - Each mode of resource usage has it's own *ideology, technology use, and economics*
        - Figuring out the tensions is a big part here
        - shows that existing battles over resource usage can be coloured in a different issue, according to different political climate (Asifa case)
    - **PART 2: Reading the Hunter-gatherer to Settlement transformation through the lens of Ecological Crisis**:
        - Consider: maybe Buddhism and Jainism is a response to the ecological crisis of the time caused due to such a major transformation.
    - **PART 3: The British Come, and The British Destroy**
- Nature and Culture and Imperialism
- Chotti Munda and His Arrow

# (Themes) Effect of Colonial Rule on Ecology and some bits of Social Structure, seen through Canals

We look in this lecture at an example where the SEN can be considered to hold: Colonial Rule. Specifically, we look at Canals and Canal Irrigation, and the ecological nightmare it has been in general. 

((this bit is a snippet))

- first bit of lecture: an aside, essentially, on how CTA criminalised any non-mainstream (non-exploitative use of nature) lifestyle.
- Impact of Canal Usage
- Human-Animal Relations in Colonial Rule

For a detailed overview, refer to [my term paper](./Assignments/1/20171076_EnP_asgn1.pdf)

# (Themes) Are we over-reading Environmental Reasons into tradition (religious or otherwise)

In this lecture, we now consider a case where the SEN is used, but does not actually hold: *An environmental reading of traditional behaviour (Religiously motivated or otherwise)*

((this bit is a snippet))

- Reading Castes in Ecological Light (Gadgill and Malhotra)
- Why Sacred Groves aren't an environmental creation, rather a human construction based on Religion
- The non-existence of so-called "Commons", rather their existence as a heirarchically controlled institution
- Adivasis aren't environmental angels; re-examining the "Secular Catechism"

For a detailed overview, refer to [Vijayraj's term paper](./Assignments/1/20171026_assignment1.pdf)
