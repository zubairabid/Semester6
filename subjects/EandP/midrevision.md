# Global Environmentalism I

## Human-Nature relationships

This Lecture is primarily on the changing Historical Conceptions of Man-Nature relationship.

Does not seem to have anything to keep in mind that will be directly asked as a question, but it is a foundational topic that can be used for arguments in future topics, and the like.

**Timeline**:

- In pre-scientific times, nature is sacred/powerful in some way:
    - **As an adversary**: feared, bringing catastrophe
    - **As a Divine Power**: punishing humans for misdeeds, to be worshipped/placated
- During the *Enlightenment*, **Nature as Dead Matter**, abiding by mechanical laws:
    - *Bacon, Descartes*: **Discover**, Master unknown laws of nature
    - *Modern Industrialism*: **Understand, and exploit**. Nature is a raw material to be utilised or exploited.
- *Romanticism*: Celebrating **Primitivism/rural lifestyle**:
    - *How*: Reaction to enlightenment and Industrial Revolution
    - *Concept*:
        - Nature as an alienated being. 
        - **Any use is exploitation**.
        - Human-animal co-existence is **criminalised**.
    - Foundational in modern Western models of environmentalism. Also see Vegans/Vegetarians
- **Marxist Conceptions**:
    - TODO

# Global Environmentalism II

## Traditional Sociological Theory on the Environment

What do "Fathers of Sociology" say about the Environment?

- **Weber**: nothing
- **Durkheim**: 
    In his work on suicides, he has a section considering human-nature relationships. But there is *no theoretical analysis, and he misses social/economic impacts on nature, and vice-versa**.
- **Marx, Engels**:
    - There is a *man-nature dialectic*
    - *Role of labour in transforming nature*
    - Alienation of nature
- **Giddens**:
    - Goes beyond "industrialism without capitalism". States, *Capitalism + Industrialism = environmental catastrophe*
- **Ulrich Beck**:
    - Idea of "Risk Society", specifically that *new risks need new institutionalised responses*
    - A shift in *organised irresponsibility* is required
